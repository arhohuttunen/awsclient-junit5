== Configuration

AWS TestKit provides an endpoint resolver mechanism to resolve endpoint configuration values for the AWS SDK clients. To provide values for configuration you need to implement an `EndpointResolver`. However, if you are using the LocalStack extension, the endpoint configuration can be omitted.

The endpoint resolver has to be added to the test using the `@AwsEndpoint` annotation. To inject AWS SDK clients to the test you can use the `@AwsClient` annotation.

The client injection only works if you have annotated the test with one of service test annotations such as `@SnsTest`.
