== LocalStack Extension

Using the `@LocalStackTest` annotation will start up LocalStack using Testcontainers for your tests. You can pass the required `services` as an argument.

If any of the service extensions (e.g. `@DynamoDbTest`, `@SnsTest`) has been provided, then the `services` argument can be omitted.

You don't need to configure an endpoint resolver when using the LocalStack extension. The extension will automatically configure an `LocalStackEndpointResolver` that works with the LocalStack container it starts.
