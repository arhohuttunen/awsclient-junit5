== Overview

AWS TestKit provides a set of JUnit 5 extensions to make testing with AWS SDK easier. AWS TestKit works with service mocks provided by tools like https://github.com/localstack/localstack[LocalStack], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html[DynamoDB Local], or even real AWS services.

At the moment only https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/home.html[AWS SDK for Java 2.x] is supported but support for AWS Java SDK v1 is planned.

Currently the following services are supported:

- CloudFormation
- DynamoDB
- Firehose
- Kinesis
- KMS
- S3
- SecretsManager
- SES
- SNS
- SQS
