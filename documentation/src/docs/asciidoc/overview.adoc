AWS TestKit provides a set of JUnit 5 extensions to make testing with AWS SDK easier. AWS TestKit works with service mocks provided by tools like LocalStack, DynamoDB Local, or even real AWS services.

Currently the following services are supported:

- CloudFormation
- DynamoDB
- Firehose
- Kinesis
- KMS
